A strong education system is widely viewed as being vital for developing countries. Such a system needs competent teachers at its core. The McKinsey's report titled "How the world's best-performing school systems come out on top" provides ample evidence to suggest that the quality of teachers is fundamental to the performance of students (Barber and Mourshed, 2007). Increasingly many educators and researchers agree. For example, student performance has been shown to be strongly influenced by the professionalism of teachers (Desimone, 2009; Yoon et al., 2007), as well as their international competitiveness (Wei et al., 2009). But perhaps most importantly, a school's accomplishments and the performance of its students are largely determined by how satisfied the teachers are with their job (Pepe et al., 2017).

When it comes to job satisfaction, teaching as a profession comes with great challenges (Mansfield et al., 2016). Many factors, including working conditions, status, and accomplishments, affect a teacher's actions and his or her teaching performance (Grion and Varisco, 2007). Teachers also are among professions that report the highest level of stress and dissatisfaction (Lomas et al., 2017). For example, as they progress from a support role to become more independent, novice teachers may experience several challenges (Le Maistre and Pare, 2010), such as praxis shock (Veenman, 1984), reality shock (Huberman, 1989), and transfer shock (Caspersen and Raeen, 2014). Feiman and Nemser (2012) describe this transition period "a time of intense learning" and "intense loneliness" (p. 10). Although their teaching can become much more effective after the first few years, many teachers quit before attaining that level of effectiveness, as approximately 40-50% of teachers exit the profession in the first five years (Fantilli and McDougall, 2009).
